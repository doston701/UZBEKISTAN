    <p>
      Andijan (sometimes spelled Andijon or Andizhan in English) (Uzbek: Andijon
      / Андижон / ئەندىجان; Persian: اندیجان, Andijân/Andīǰān; Russian: Андижан,
      Andižan) is a city in Uzbekistan. It is the administrative, economic, and
      cultural center of Andijan Region.[2] Andijan is a district-level city
      with an area of 74 km2 (29 sq mi)[3] and it had 458,400 inhabitants in
      2022.[4] Andijan is located in the south-eastern edge of the Fergana
      Valley near Uzbekistan's border with Kyrgyzstan.[5] Andijan is one of the
      oldest cities in the Fergana Valley. In some parts of the city,
      archeologists have found items dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries.
      Historically, Andijan was an important city on the Silk Road. The city is
      perhaps best known as the birthplace of Babur who, following a series of
      setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal dynasty in
      the Indian subcontinent and became the first Mughal emperor. Andijan also
      gained notoriety in 2005 when government forces opened fire on protestors,
      killing hundreds in what came to be known as the Andijan Massacre. Andijan
      was developed into an important industrial city during the Soviet era.
      Manufactured goods produced in the city include chemicals, domestic
      appliances, electronics, foodstuffs, furniture, plows, pumps, shoes, spare
      parts for farming machines, various engineering tools, and wheelchairs.
