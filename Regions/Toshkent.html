    <p>
      Etymology During its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in
      names and political and religious affiliations. Abu Rayhan Biruni wrote
      that the city's name Tashkent comes from the Turkic tash and kent,
      literally translated as "Stone City" or "City of Stones".[5] Ilya
      Gershevitch (1974:55, 72) (apud Livshits, 2007:179) traces the city's old
      name Chach back to Old Iranian *čāiča- "area of water, lake" (cf. Lake
      Čaēčista mentioned in the Avesta) (whence Middle Chinese transcription
      *źiäk > standard Chinese Shí with Chinese character 石 for "stone"[6][7]),
      and *Čačkand ~ Čačkanθ was the basis for Turkic adaption Tashkent,
      popularly etymologized as "stone city".[8] Early history Tashkent was
      first settled some time between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC by ancient
      people as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West
      Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian,
      probably the summer "capital" of the Kangju confederacy.[9] Some scholars
      believe that a "Stone Tower" mentioned by Ptolemy in his famous treatise
      Geography, and by other early accounts of travel on the old Silk Road,
      referred to this settlement (due to its etymology). This tower is said to
      have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars,
      however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four
      most probable sites for the Stone Tower.[10][11] History as Chach
