      The Rabati Malik is a heavily fortified 11th century caravanserai built by
      the Karakhanid ruler Abu’l Hasan Shams al Mulk Nasr to protect Silk Road
      merchants, their animals, and trade goods at night.[9] The building is on
      UNESCO’s Tentative List for World Heritage Site status, along with Sardoba
      Malik, the domed reservoir which supplied the caravanserai with water.[10]
      Rabati Malik is largely in ruins due to an earthquake in 1968, but the 12m
      high portal still stands and has been partially restored, as has the
      reservoir dome. The portal is decorated with carved terracotta, including
      eight-pointed stars and Arabic calligraphy.[10] The Deggaroniy Mausoleum
      is the burial place of the theologian Mavlono Orif Deggaroniy (1313–76),
      teacher of Khoja Bahauddin Naqshbandi.[9] It is a simple mud brick
      building with low domes, and is a place of pilgrimage for Naqshbandi
      Sufis. The Mir Said Bakhrom Mausoleum is a simple brick built mausoleum
      dating from the 11th century.[9] The building is an important
      architectural prototype, with certain similarities to the Samanid
      Mausoleum in Bukhara.The portal is decorated with a Kufic inscription made
      from raised bricks, and the saint’s grave is covered with marble. The
      building is on UNESCO’s Tentative List for World Heritage Site status.[10]

      to the public. There is an attractive turquoise dome and majolica tile
      work on the exterior of the building, and the interior is painted in
      geometric patterns in shades of blue. Navoiy Central Market, Navoiy,
