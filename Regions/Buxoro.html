      In 673/674, with the attack of Ubaidallah ibn Ziyad as part of the Arab
      conquest campaigns, a series of raids by the Muslim Arabs against Bukhara,
      supported by troops of Turkish peoples, began. Although each victorious,
      the Arabs were initially unable to secure permanent rule over Transoxania.
      This changed only under Qutaiba ibn Muslim, who tried to Islamize the
      inhabitants of Bukhara between 706 and 709 with difficulty and was
      installed as ruler of Bukhara in 710. In early Islamic times, the rulers
      of Bukhara were known as Buchār Chudāt (or Buchār Chudāh). The Umayyads,
      however, had difficulty asserting themselves in Central Asia. Abu Muslim
      was partly responsible for the victory of the Abbasids, but his rule was
      not accepted in Bukhara, where a first revolt took place in 750, which was
      bloodily suppressed. Further uprisings with various alliances and goals
      followed, such as between 776 and 779 under Al-Mukanna. This period of
      unrest did not come to an end until the Persian Samanids came to power in
      865 and Bukhara became the capital of a powerful empire, a thriving center
      of trade and crafts, and a spiritual pole of Islam in the East. [3] Last

      Mausoleum of the Samanids is the oldest surviving building in the city
      After the end of the Samanid rule by the invasion of Turkish peoples, the
      place under the sovereignty of the Turkish Qarakhanids lost its political
      importance from 999, but the cultural flowering of the city under the
      western Qarakhanids is evidenced by two important architectural monuments:
      the Kalon minaret (Minār-i Qalyān, dated by an inscription to 1127) and
      the south façade of the Mag'oki Attori Mosque , which was renewed at that
      time ( Masǧid-i maġāk-i ʿaṭṭārī). Above all, the long reign of Arslan Khan
      (1102–1130) was characterized by relative prosperity and stability.
      However, since the late 11th century, the Western Qarakhanids had to
      recognize the supremacy of the Great Seljuks, which was followed in 1141
      by that of the non-Muslim Kara-Chitai. Bukhara was ruled during this
      period of changing overlords (12th to early 13th centuries) mostly by the
      local dynasty of the Burhanids, which were a number of spiritual leaders
      (Hanafites) with the title Sadr. After the Khorezm Shah Atsiz had already
      attacked the city in 1139/40, it was conquered in 1182 (and perhaps again
      in 1198) by his grandson Ala ad-Din Tekish and finally came under the rule
      of Tekish's son Muhammad II in 1207.
