    <h2>About Surhandaryo</h2>
    <p>
      Surxondaryo Region (Uzbek: Surxondaryo viloyati, Сурхондарё вилояти,
      سرخان‌دریا ولایت, Russian: Сурхандарьинская область, Persian: سرخان‌دریا,
      UniPers: "sorxāndaryā"), old spelling Surkhandarya Region is a region
      (viloyat) of Uzbekistan, located in the extreme south-east of the country.
      Established on March 6, 1941, it borders on Qashqadaryo Region internally,
      and Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan externally, going
      anticlockwise from the north. It takes its name from the river
      Surxondaryo, that flows through the region. It covers an area of 20,100
      km².[2] The population is estimated at 2,743,201 (beginning of 2022 data),
      with 80% living in rural areas.[3][4] According to official data, 83% of
      the population are Uzbeks and 12,5% Tajiks,[5] but non-official statistics
      show Surxondaryo is a Persian-speaking area, because most Tajiks of
      Uzbekistan are concentrated in the Surxondaryo, Samarkand and Bukhara
      regions.[6] The highest point of the Region and also of Uzbekistan is
      Khazrati Sulton peak reaching 4,643 m/15,233 ft in Gissar Range.[7] The
      regional capital is Termez (Termiz) with population of 122,900 (2021),[1]
      and the second largest city is Denov (Denau) with 69,500 inhabitants (data
      for 2005).[4] Other towns include Boysun, Jarqoʻrgʻon, Qumqoʻrgʻon,
      Shargʻun, Sherobod, Shoʻrchi, and Sariosiyo. The climate is continental,
      with mild wet winters and hot dry summers. The southern part of the region
      is in the Badkhiz-Karabil semi-desert ecoregion (PA0808), characterized by
      a savanna of pistachio and desert sedge. The northern portion is
      characterized by open woodlands (Gissaro-Alai open woodlands ecoregion,
      PA1306), with characteristic plants being pistachio, almond, walnut,
      apple, and juniper. Sagebrush is common at lower elevations [8][9] Natural
      resources include petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Light industry, mainly
      cotton ginning and food processing, is also an important part of the
      regional economy, particularly in the production of consumer goods.
      Agriculture is based primarily on cotton and cereals, supplemented with
      horticulture and viticulture. Surxondaryo is the country's largest
      supplier of long-fiber cotton. Livestock accounts for 40% of regional
      agricultural product.[4] The climatic conditions of this region also make
      it possible to cultivate subtropical crops such as sugarcane. The region
      has a well-developed transport infrastructure, with 300 km of railways and
      2,700 km of surfaced roads.[4] Central Asia's only river port is located
      at Termez on the Amudarya River.
