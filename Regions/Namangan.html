    <p>
      The city takes its name from the local salt mines (in Persian نمک‌کان
      (namak kan) — "a salt mine").[5] Babur mentioned the village of Namangan
      in his memoirs Baburnama.[6] In his book A brief History of the Khanate of
      Kokand (Russian: Краткая история Кокандского ханства) (Kazan, 1886), the
      Russian ethnographer Vladimir Petrovich Nalivkin wrote that Namangan is
      mentioned in legal documents dating back to 1643.[6] The city of Namangan
      dates back to the 17th cent. A local salt miner's settlement (naman kann)
      appeared in the north of the Ferghana valley. The inhabitants of Aksikent
      (Ahsykenta) migrated here in the 17th Century after the destructive
      earthquakes. Aksikent is the old city that was once the center of the
      valley of Fergana. The city was the province's administrative centre in
      the middle of the 18th century (viloyat). [1][7] Namangan, like many other
      cities in the Fergana valley, was originally populated by Sogdian people,
      although it later became a Persian speaking city; the local variety of
      Persian became known as the Tajik language. An influx of Turkic-speaking
      people into the region, starting in late medieval times, led to
      turkification. While Namangan still had a Tajik majority until the middle
      of the 19th century, identification of its residents with Turkic rather
      than Iranian cultures has increased. By the late 20th century, most
      residents of Namangan speak Uzbek,[citation needed] albeit with a
      significant Tajik-speaking minority. Politically, Namangan became a part
      of the Uyghur Empire of the Karakhanid State and was known to have been a
      settlement in the 15th century. The residents of the ancient city of
      Akhsikat, which was severely damaged by an earthquake, moved to the
      then-village of Namangan in 1610.[8] Namangan became a city afterward.[8]
      On the eve of the Russian invasion in 1867, the town had been a part of
      the Khanate of Kokand since the middle of the 18th century.[9][10]
      Namangan was hit by a destructive earthquake in 1926 which killed 34
      people, injured 72, and destroyed 4,850 houses.[11] Since Uzbekistan's
      independence in 1991, Namangan has gained a reputation for Islamic
      revivalism, with many mosques and schools funded by organizations from
      Middle Eastern countries, including the extremist Wahhabi sect from Saudi
      Arabia that produced jihadist terrorists like Juma Namangani who fought
      and died in support of the Afghan Taliban and the Al Qaeda.[12][13] This
      has also translated into political opposition against the secular
      government of Uzbekistan. Some women have discarded traditional colorful
      scarves for large white veils or even the black paranja.[14]
