    <p>
      Jizzakh is an ancient oasis. The Turkestan and Nurata ridges, which
      surround the southern and part of the western part of the country, and the
      Arnasay-Aydar-Tuzkan lakes in the northern part of the country, provides a
      temperate climate.[citation needed] The peaks are covered with snow and
      glaciers, Chovkar mountain, in the foothills of the Usturshona system
      there are thick pine forests. From the slopes of the mountains at an
      altitude of 1800 meters above sea level, pine forests begin. As the
      mountains rise, the pine forest thickens. There are more than 20 caves in
      the region. Although they have not been studied by experts, only amateurs
      who have observed the Peshawar cave recall that inside the cave there is a
      large and long square (hall), a red hearth, paintings on stone walls and
      petroglyphic inscriptions abound. In addition, the long cave is
      artificially fenced and additional stairs are made for the next hall,
      which testifies to the fact that primitive people lived here in ancient
      times. The huge cave south of Mount Molguzar was once used as a Buddhist
      temple. The book "History of the Sui Dynasty" also mentions the Eastern
      TSao (Usturshona), "There is the city of Yecha. It is a closed cave in the
      city and is sacrificed twice a year. Or the cultural Tavakbulak, located
      on the shoulders of Mount Molguzar at an altitude of two thousand six
      hundred meters above sea level, can be called a miracle. On the river
      Aktash in Bakhmal district there is a huge cemetery on the shoulders of
      steep mountains, next to it there is a magnificent gorge "Blood Drop". Or
      the spring that rises from the Suffa Square at the top of the mountain in
      Zaamin district, the nearby Muzbulak, the garden built on the top of a
      high mountain in Bakhmal - all this speaks of ancient history. Rivers
      attached to the mountains, springs flowing from glaciers, groves covering
      the ravines. About 100 medicinal herbsâ€¦ On the banks of the Poyimard river
      in Jizzakh district, in the middle of a 20-meter-high rocky outcrop, all
      of them are natural monuments, all of which testify to the existence of
      primitive man.
