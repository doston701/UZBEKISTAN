    <p>
      Samarkand (/ˈsæmərkænd/; Uzbek: Самарқанд, Samarqand, pronounced
      [samarqand, –qant]; Tajik: Самарқанд; Persian: سمرقند; Sogdian: *smā́rkąθ,
      𐼑𐼍𐼀𐼘𐼋𐼎𐼌𐼆‎, 𐼼𐼺𐼰𐽀𐼸𐼻𐼹𐼳‎ smʾrknδH), also known as Samarqand, is a city in
      southeastern Uzbekistan and among the oldest continuously inhabited cities
      in Central Asia. There is evidence of human activity in the area of the
      city from the late Paleolithic Era, though there is no direct evidence of
      when Samarkand was founded; several theories propose that it was founded
      between the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. Prospering from its location on the
      Silk Road between China and Europe, at times Samarkand was one of the
      largest[2] cities of Central Asia.[3] Most of the inhabitants of this city
      are native Persian-speakers and speak the Tajik Persian dialect. This city
      is one of the historical centers of the Tajik people in Central Asia,
      which in the past was one of the important cities of the great empires of
      Iran.[4][5] By the time of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, it was the
      capital of the Sogdian satrapy. The city was conquered by Alexander the
      Great in 329 BCE, when it was known as Markanda, which was rendered in
      Greek as Μαράκανδα.[6] The city was ruled by a succession of Iranian and
      Turkic rulers until it was conquered by the Mongols under Genghis Khan in
      1220. Today, Samarkand is the capital of Samarqand Region and a
      district-level city, that includes the urban-type settlements Kimyogarlar,
      Farxod and Xishrav.[7] With 551,700 inhabitants (2021),[8] it is the
      second-largest city of Uzbekistan.[citation needed] The city is noted as a
      centre of Islamic scholarly study and the birthplace of the Timurid
      Renaissance. In the 14th century, Timur (Tamerlane) made it the capital of
      his empire and the site of his mausoleum, the Gur-e Amir. The Bibi-Khanym
      Mosque, rebuilt during the Soviet era, remains one of the city's most
      notable landmarks. Samarkand's Registan square was the city's ancient
      centre and is bounded by three monumental religious buildings. The city
      has carefully preserved the traditions of ancient crafts: embroidery,
      goldwork, silk weaving, copper engraving, ceramics, wood carving, and wood
      painting.[9] In 2001, UNESCO added the city to its World Heritage List as
      Samarkand – Crossroads of Cultures. Modern Samarkand is divided into two
      parts: the old city, and the new city, which was developed during the days
      of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. The old city includes historical
      monuments, shops, and old private houses; the new city includes
      administrative buildings along with cultural centres and educational
      institutions.[10]
