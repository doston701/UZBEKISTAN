      خارەزم ۋىلايەتى, Russian: Хорезмская область) or Khorezm Region as it is
      still more commonly known, is a viloyat (region) of Uzbekistan located in
      the northwest of the country in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya River.
      It borders with Turkmenistan, Karakalpakstan, and Bukhara Region. It
      covers an area of 6,050 square kilometres (2,340 sq mi).[1] The population
      is estimated 1,893,300 (2021), with 67% living in rural areas.[2] The
      capital is Urgench (pop. est. 145,000). Other major towns include Xonqa,
      Khiva, Shovot, and Pitnak. View of the central market area of Urgench from

      Urgench. The climate is a typically arid continental climate, with cold
      winters and extremely hot, dry summers. The city of Khiva in Khorezm
      Region is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with world-famous architectural
      monuments, making Khiva one of the main centers for international tourism
      in the country. The economy of Khorezm Region is primarily based on
      cotton. Cotton is by far the main crop, although rice production has
      increased significantly in the last several years. (though the Uzbek
      government discourages rice production near to deserts, over water usage
      concerns) There are also many orchards and vineyards, melon and gourd
      plantations and potato fields. Khorezm Region is famous for its "gurvak"
      melon in Uzbekistan. Industry is also heavily oriented to cotton, with
      cotton refining, cottonseed oil extraction and textiles predominating.
      Khorezm is a place where many famous scholars were born, such as Abu
      Rayhan Biruni and al-Khwārizmī. The region has a well-developed
      transportation infrastructure, with over 130 km of railways and 2000 km of
      surfaced roads. The region is connected by rail to European Russia and the
      Caucasus.
