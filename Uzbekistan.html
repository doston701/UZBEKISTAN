      <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>
      <i
        >(UK: /ʊzˌbɛkɪˈstɑːn, ʌz-, -ˈstæn/, US: /ʊzˈbɛkɪstæn, -stɑːn/;[11][12]
        Uzbek: Oʻzbekiston/Ўзбекистон, pronounced [ozbekiˈstɒn])</i
      >
      , officially the Republic of Uzbekistan
      <i> (Uzbek: Oʻzbekiston Respublikasi/Ўзбекистон Республикаси)</i> , is a
      doubly landlocked country located in Central Asia. It is surrounded by
      five landlocked countries: Kazakhstan to the north; Kyrgyzstan to the
      northeast; Tajikistan to the southeast; Afghanistan to the south; and
      Turkmenistan to the southwest. Its capital and largest city is Tashkent.
      Uzbekistan is part of the Turkic world, as well as a member of the
      Organization of Turkic States. The Uzbek language is the majority-spoken
      language in Uzbekistan; other languages include the Russian language and
      the Tajik language. Islam is the predominant religion in Uzbekistan, most
      Uzbeks being Sunni Muslims.[13] The first recorded settlers in what is now
      Uzbekistan were Eastern Iranian nomads, known as Scythians, who founded
      kingdoms in Khwarazm <i> (8th–6th centuries BC)</i> , Bactria
      <i> (8th–6th centuries BC)</i> , Sogdia <i>(8th–6th centuries BC)</i> ,
      Fergana <i>(3rd century BC – sixth century AD)</i> , and Margiana
      <i>(3rd century BC – sixth century AD)</i> .[14] The area was incorporated
      into the Iranian Achaemenid Empire and, after a period of Macedonian rule,
      was ruled by the Iranian Parthian Empire and later by the Sasanian Empire,
      until the Muslim conquest of Persia in the seventh century. The Early
      Muslim conquests and the subsequent Samanid Empire converted most of the
      people, including the local ruling classes, into adherents of Islam.
      During this period, cities such as Samarkand, Khiva, and Bukhara began to
      grow rich from the Silk Road, and became a center of the Islamic Golden
      Age, with figures such as Muhammad al-Bukhari, Al-Tirmidhi, al Khwarizmi,
      al-Biruni, Avicenna and Omar Khayyam.
